# Unit P — Regen Registry Packet Workspace (Proposal-only)

Goal: Provide a compact UI to generate + validate a Regen registry project packet,
and optionally attach it to Work + Proof (no submission).

Done when:
- `/regen/projects` page exists
- Uses `/api/agent/regen/projects` (unit 56) or `/api/agent/regen` if present
- Produces a Work item draft and a Proof object draft (client-side) without execution.
