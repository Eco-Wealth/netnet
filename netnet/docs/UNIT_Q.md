# Unit Q — Economics Loop Integration (revenue → allocate → retire intent)

Goal: Make the economics loop actionable from the UI:
- pull revenue report
- generate an allocation packet
- generate a retire-intent packet (still operator-approved)
- optionally create a work item with attached packet

Done when:
- `/economics/loop` page exists and is usable without external integrations.
