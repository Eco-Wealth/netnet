# Unit V — UX Regression + Accessibility (scaffold)

Goal: Establish a repeatable UX/Accessibility smoke checklist without committing to heavy tooling yet.

## What it adds
- `docs/UX_REGRESSION_CHECKLIST.md`
- `scripts/ux_smoke.sh` (optional helper)

## Notes
This does not modify the app; it is a process + lightweight helper only.
